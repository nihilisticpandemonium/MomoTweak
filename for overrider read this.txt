If you want to override my recipe and don't know what the recipe name?

I have solution for you

call momoTweak.find_recipe_from_result( "result_item_name" )

or momoTweak.find_recipe_from_ingredient( "ingredient_item_name" )

EXAMPLE:

momoTweak.find_recipe_from_ingredient("coal")

use it in data-final-fixes.lua on your mod not mine
 
run the game get an error close it

then check log file search for
